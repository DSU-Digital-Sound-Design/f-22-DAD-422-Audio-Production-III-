title: "Atmos Music mix - Ocean Eyes"
---

You will use Logic Pro X to create an Atmos mix of Billy Elish's _Ocean Eyes_. You can find the stereo mix on the studio b computer in the demo folder. You will need to convert it into an Atmos mix to start.

In Project Settings -> Audio -> General, set _Spatial Audio_ to _Dolby Atmos_, then set the _Surround Format_ to _7.1.2_. Use a combination of bed and object tracks to create a convincing atmos mix. Don't use any stereo panning modes.

To convert from a stereo panner change the output routing to _Surround_. This will now give you a Logic _Surround Panner_. Right click and select _3D Object Panner_ if you want pan this track with an object channel.

Add some panning automation to at least two tracks.

Save your project file into the folder in studio b called _DAD 422 - Dolby Atmos Ocean Eyes Turn-in Folder_.
