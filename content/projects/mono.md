title: "Project 1: Mono"
---

Pick a silent film from the [Archive.org silent film archive](https://archive.org/details/silenthalloffame). Create sound design for any 30 second clip in the movie you choose. Add enough sound effects to create a feeling of realism. You are limited to **mono playback**, so think of the ways in which you can simulate a space with only one channel. You could accomplish this using reverb, or delay, filtering, or loudness.

Submit a rendered video file to D2L along with a paragraph explaining your process for spatialization using the limitations of the project.

See [SoundQ](https://www.prosoundeffects.com/soundq/) for a great way to search through freesound.org and other sound effects libraries.
