Your assignment this week is to create a monophonic playback piece. Consider the materials of your speakers and their position and placement in the material they are playing.  

You _must_ document your piece and submit it by email before the start of class. Five of you will show your documentation in class. Consider including a score or some graphical representation of the piece in your documentation.
