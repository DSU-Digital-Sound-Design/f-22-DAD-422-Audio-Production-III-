title: "Project 3"
---

Your assignment this week is to create a four-channel piece. For this assignment, the speakers will be assumed to either be in a ring facing inward or in a ring facing outward from the center. Consider how a listener interacts with the physical space of the piece by walking around the center or periphery of the speakers.  

You _must_ document your piece and submit it by email before the start of class. Some of you will show your documentation in class.
