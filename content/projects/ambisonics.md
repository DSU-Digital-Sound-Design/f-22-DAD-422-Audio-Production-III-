title: "Ambisonics"

To start your ambisonics mix open Reaper. Then in the file menu go to Project Templates -> Ambisonics-TCB-208. This will open a project template that you can use to start your project. Read the details of the project to get started.

Create a ambisonic music, sound design, or narrative fiction that uses ambisonic, stereo, and mono recording techniques. The piece should be one minute long. It can accompany a visual or stand alone. One of the recordings should use a stereo recording technique we learned in class. Another recording will use the Zoom H3-VR device in Ambisonic mode. Include at least two panning automation moves. This could be to create a “fly-by” effect or another dynamic panning effect. All other sounds can be mono sources, but make sure to put some thought into how they are spatialized.

Use [Ambisonic Toolkit for Reaper](https://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/download/reaper/) plugins to mix your project. Use the HO-DirAC Decoder to hear your mix in our surround studio. Make sure the prest is set to "7.1 Room 208". The decoding format should be FuMa.

The rest of the requirements are similar to the binaural project. If you want, you can remix that project, adding an ambisonic recording and altering your transforms for loudspeaker playback instead of headphones.
