title: "Mixing in Atmos with Protools"
---

- basic setup

## Lange Session

- Clicks - step sequenced panning, each step can have a single location or trajectory
- Lange stemed his mix down to 34 tracks for mixing in Atmos, this mix only uses Atmos panning, no other plugins
- Kick drum just using protools native surround plugin. We can try playing around with the divergence here to make it sound like it's coming out of all speakers more equally.
- Claps - hard panned to the L/LS, and R/RS
- Crackle - atmos panner - using automation for the objects
  - also panning linking mode, mirroring to copy, which turns the sound into mono for panning around the room.
- kidiegren - has elevation, that we're not really hearing
