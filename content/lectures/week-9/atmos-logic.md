title: "Dolby Atmos with Logic X"
---

## Implementation

While Protools uses the standalone atmos renderer that we saw last week Logic uses a built in render. This is more convenient, but has drawbacks for the more professional user.

# Channel Routing

## Mono Components vs. Stereo Components

## Output Routing

These menus are dynamic and change depending on what audio interface you're connected to.

## Surround Formats

Changing the format here will change what each plugin can do. See the surround panner when changing surround formats, the speaker count changes.

## I/O Assignments (Output/Speakers)

## Master Channel Strip

Changing one track to surround mode updates your master channel strip.
