# Coincident Techniques

{{% note %}}
In coincident arrangements, the microphone capsules are usually aligned on top of each other along a vertical axis, while including a certain ‘opening angle’ in the horizontal axis. The signal differences between the two channels of the stereo signal are caused by the volume differences that occur due to the directional characteristics of the capsules. The usual patterns are subcardioid, cardioid, hyper-cardioid and figure-of-eight.

## XY with Cardioids and Hyper-cardioids

Since individual micro- phones pick up the largest part of a sound-source only ‘off-axis,’ it is desirable for them to have an overall very flat frequency response in order to keep sound coloration to a minimum. Due to this reason, for stereo recordings so-called matched pairs of microphones get used, which are very similar in terms of frequency response, as well as polar pattern.

When using microphones with cardioid patterns, the most common opening angles are between 90 and 120°, while the axis of the microphones may sometimes be pointing toward the L and R edge of the sound source.

When hyper-cardioids are used, usually a narrower physical opening angle is preferred in order to achieve a more stable image at the center of the sound source. Due to the stronger directional characteristic, hyper-cardioids can be positioned further away from the sound source than microphones with a cardioid pattern (keyword: direct-to-reverberant sound ratio, or ‘D/R-ratio’)
