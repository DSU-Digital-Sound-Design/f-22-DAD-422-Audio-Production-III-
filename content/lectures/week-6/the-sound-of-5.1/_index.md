## The Sound Of 5.1

## Aural Aesthetics

---

> The design, technical considerations, and specifications that went into the digital sound track are to provide a medium that theoretically has no limitation. The digital medium is not the restrictive part of the process anymore.

1990s - 5.1 digital surround first appeared and gave filmmakers

- better dynamic range,
- more channels
- more flexibility for spatialization of sounds

But, movies could not take full advantage of these capabilities yet.

- Few theaters had DSS systems
- Filmmakers had to make sure their soundtracks sounded good mixed with Dolby Stereo

### Today's Landscape

- 5.1 is a standard
- Many theaters also using Dolby Surround 7.1
- [6900+ Dolby Atmos theatres](https://professional.dolby.com/cinema/) across 100+ countries

{{% note %}}
Because of the standardization of surround in movie theatres and home setups, filmmakers became less concerned with how their work will sound with Dolby Stereo.

### Movies got louder

- DSS has a larger dynamic range than previous formats
- Factors for dynamic range
  - Amount of space available for audio data
  - Analogue - 35mm filmstrip (Dolby SR) - 78 dB
  - Digital surround formats (Dolby Digital, SDSS, DTS) - over 100 dB

{{% note %}}
In lay terms, **dynamic range** is the difference between the loudest and softest sounds a system can reproduce. From a technical standpoint, it is measured in decibels (dB) and can be found by adding a format’s headroom (how much louder than a designated reference level a signal can be before it distorts or clips) to its signal-to- noise ratio (the distance between that reference level and the inherent noise of the system).

In the case of a 35mm filmstrip, the Dolby- encoded soundtrack must fit into the narrow gap between image and sprocket holes, which is only about 2mm wide. Because of this limitation, Dolby SR film soundtracks only achieve a dynamic range of about 78 dB—far less than Dolby SR encoding offers in other formats with more space for the soundtrack.

Digital surround’s wide dynamic range means that within any given movie, it can include both very loud sounds and very soft ones, in theory surpassing the capabilities of Dolby Stereo and Dolby SR on both ends.

### Movies headroom

- Headroom - how much louder than its “average” volume level a soundtrack’s loudest parts can be.
- 1960s - monophonic sound - 6 dB headroom
- Dolby SR - 6 - 12 dB headroom (depending of frequency of sound)
- DSS - 20 dB headroom across entire frequency spectrum

{{% note %}}
In the late sixties, monophonic sound had headroom of about 6 dB, meaning

> “the loudest sounds in the film could be six decibels over the level of average dialogue.”

Since a 10 dB difference represents a doubling of perceived loudness, these numbers mean that relative to the “average” volume level of a soundtrack—for instance, the level of most dialogue—a digital soundtrack can make loud sounds that are more than twice as loud as the loudest sounds possible with Dolby SR.

> When the digital format came out. . . . there were, in my opinion, a series of not very good and just painful mixes. Directors thought it was good: “My movie is going to be the best movie ever” . . . it was the big action pictures, they used to have to be loud.

In a properly calibrated theatrical setup, DSS soundtracks can get loud enough to approach the human threshold of pain.

> You may think it’s great and exciting and normal, but it’s not. . . . about 90 percent of America just doesn’t want to listen to stuff that loud at any time.

The problem with this approach, of course, was that while sitting in mixing studios for hours and days on end accustomed filmmakers to these extremely high volume levels, what they saw as normal was well beyond what most audiences considered comfortable

Audiences began to complain so mixes came down in level somewhat.

> A lot of movies are just loud all the time. . . . Underworld was probably the loudest movie I’ve seen in a long time. Every single kick, punch, whatever it was—everything had to be as loud as possible. Whereas a movie like that could have been a lot more effective had it been quieter in scenes instead of just loud all the time.

Still, overly loud mixes remain a concern among film sound professionals, many of whom find that only the high end of DSS’s dynamic range is being used:

DSS allows sounds in film to be much quieter as well as louder.

> The well-known fact that nearly all theaters play films at a lower level than they were mixed ironically causes many directors to insist that their films be mixed even louder in a desperate effort to compensate for the anticipated reduction, which of course causes the theaters to turn the sound down even more, etc., etc. ad infinitum.

In their defense, theater owners play films at lower volumes than official standards dictate in an effort to provide the best possible movie going experience. The screens in some multiplex theaters are packed so close together, with so little soundproofing between them, that soundtracks played at their full intended volume bleed into neighbor- ing theaters. Turning down the volume prohibits this bleed, though a better solution would be sonically isolating each theater in the first place.

Also, trailers tend to be mixed much louder than features, as they are advertisements meant to get your attention.

## Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcQouZIPqNs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
The opening sequence of Terminator 2: Judgment Day offers the most sig- nificant use of ambience in the film. After the flair of a nuclear explosion, the ambience of wind comes in, and the camera reveals a devastated Los Angeles in 2029 A.D. The ambience is sweetened with the sound of sand and dust playing across various surfaces, metal, and bone. Contrast this with the prior sound effect of a young girl’s laughter and the juxtaposition is telling. The future represented by the child’s voice is wiped away by the impact of a manmade technology, a nuclear weapon. In her voice-over, Sarah Connor invokes the religious prophecy of “Judgment Day” to de- scribe the event. (This also serves as an intertextual reference to the first Terminator film from 1984, which describes the war as a “storm.”) These are the sounds of Armageddon. Vivian Sobchack notes one important aspect of wind in the science fiction genre:

## Contact (1997)

{{% note %}}
The opening sequence of Contact (1997) similarly uses silence to great effect. The movie begins with a tracking shot that starts at the earth and moves out until it encompasses the entire galaxy. While this scene begins with sound, it ends in the total silence of empty space. Here even the quiet speaker hiss of a Dolby Stereo “silence” would be reassuring, but director Robert Zemeckis refuses to temper the scene with any such aural object. Instead, he uses the total silence made available by DSS to emphasize the feeling of emptiness this scene engenders.

## Frost/Nixon (2008)

{{% note %}}
Digital surround’s increased dynamic range allows increased flexibility in the use of “relative” silence, since even sounds played at a “normal” volume can be relatively silent in the context of a noticeably louder or busier soundtrack. The climax of the 2008 film Frost/Nixon, for instance, uses relational silence to focus the audience’s ears and emotional attentions on the moment when Frost finally draws an ad- mission of wrongdoing out of the ex-president. In earlier segments of their conversations, the soundtrack included not only Frost and Nixon’s dialogue but also the sounds of the television crew around them, the room tone of the location, and Foley. But for this key moment, every- thing but Nixon’s voice drops out of the soundtrack.

## Superman Returns (2006)

Superman Returns (2006) takes a similar approach when a surgeon is picking shards of kryptonite from the hero’s body: all sounds other than the clank of the shards dropping onto a table disappear. In both cases, while the emphasized sounds (Nixon’s voice and the clinks of shards hitting metal) are actually fairly loud, the soundtrack seems silent due to its relative emptiness.

### Backdraft (1991)

Even before dolby digital it was really common to have quiet parts right before loud parts to make the audience perceive explosions more loudly. Gary Rydstrom explains:

> Just before an explosion, I like to have a moment of silence or expectation, have an explosion preceded by a sucking in of air, a light high sound, then a rest, and then the explosion coming in as a surprise.”

DSS makes this process much more intense, by having quieter quiets and louder loud parts.

Examples of filmmakers pairing true silences with loud transient sounds like explosions to exploit digital surround sound’s full dynamic range can be found in a wide variety of films.

Obi-Wan Kenobi is chasing Jango Fett through an asteroid field. To distract his pursuer, Fett launches a series of bombs that, in keeping with the Star Wars franchise’s tradition of ignoring the laws of physics, cause huge, theater- rattling explosions. The explosions are reasonably loud on their own, but Lucas makes them sound even louder than they actually are by dropping out all other sounds from the soundtrack about a half second before each one.

> You could listen to a symphony played at full blast with all the instruments at the same level for about ten minutes, and then it would begin to pall on you. What the musicians of the nineteenth century began to discover . . . was the idea of dynamics within each movement, of shrink- ing the orchestration down to a single instrument and then expanding it outward again at the right moment. It’s an approach that generally characterizes nineteenth-century music and is well suited to film.
