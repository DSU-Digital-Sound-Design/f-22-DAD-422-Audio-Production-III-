## Discrete Channels And Complexity

> Why is 5.1 a notable improvement over Dolby Stereo?

{{% note %}}
When most people think about digital sound, “improved dynamic range” is not the first issue that comes to mind. That honor would go to DSS’s multi-channel capabilities. “5.1” is now a part of everyday language, a fact that speaks not only to digital surround’s ubiquity in contemporary media but to DSS’s fundamental association with multi- channel sound.

- Dolby Stereo ostensibly includes four channels—left, center, and right front plus mono surround—and, ignoring for the moment the LFE channel,
- digital surround systems employ the same basic setup other than splitting the mono surround channel into stereo.
- Digital surround sound, in contrast, offers _completely discrete audio channels_, meaning that the content in each one of its six channels is completely independent of what is in the others.
- ability for literally more sounds to play at the same time.

Digital sound, on the other hand, provided five separate channels across which sounds could spread. Filmmakers eagerly took advantage of this option,

## Masking

> When collapsed to one speaker or headphones, one sound of greater amplitude can cover another sound, creating a condition known as masking. . . . Variations of sound location, density, and volume in the surround channels can punctuate events on screen without the loss of intelligibility that might occur if the entire sound track was limited to the center speakers.

{{% note %}}
So since we are avoiding masking, we can put more _separately perceptible_ sounds in a soundtrack at a time.

## Complexity

> the general level of complexity . . . has been steadily increasing over the eight decades since film sound was invented. . . . Seventy years ago, for instance, it would not be unusual for an entire film to need only fifteen to twenty sound effects. Today that number could be hundreds to thou- sands of times greater.

## Audiences ability to perceive sound

- Humans can only pay attention to a limited amount of sounds at once
- re-recording mixers know this and hence shape their soundtracks to focus audience attention on only two (or at most three) perceived aural objects at a time.
- More sounds can be used if they are dissimilar

{{% note %}}
Overloading an audience can be used by a sound designer to create a particular emotion of a chaotic scene or something out of control. This should be used sparingly as to not overwhelm the audience to annoyance.

## Terminator 2

Show extended freeway chase scene

{{% note %}}
Its biggest action sequence, an extended freeway chase, moves a huge number of sounds around the multi-channel soundscape. Whether or not the audience actually notices all the individual sounds is irrelevant—in either case the feeling created is one of intense movement, speed, and action.

## Kinsey (2004)

- Driving across the country interviewing people for a study

{{% note %}}
A montage sequence in Kinsey (2004) employs an even more complex mix than that of T2’s freeway chase. While the title character crisscrosses the country interviewing people for his sex study, the faces of his various interviewees appear onscreen over a U.S. map. Their voices also begin to mingle together and spread throughout the theater as they recount their stories. By the montage’s end, all five main sound channels are playing different sets of voices. These voices remain individually discernable, and audience members can choose if they want to focus on any particular voice to hear its story; alternately, they can simply listen to the mix as a whole, which continuously shifts focus among different voices. The result either way is a feeling of being overwhelmed by the number of different points of view present, an emotion made more powerful by the clear sense that this is not just “walla” sound but a vast collection of individual voices, all of whom have something worth saying.

## Any sound, anywhere

{{% note %}}
Digital surround sound’s discrete channel system is not, of course, used only to increase soundtrack complexity. It also allows filmmakers to place each element of the soundtrack precisely in any of the five channels around the theater.

## Gladiator (2000)

Maximus walks from a small enclosed space out into the arena

{{% note %}}
As an example, a scene in Gladiator (2000) where Maximus (the film’s hero, played by Russell Crowe) walks from a small enclosed space out into a giant arena uses a gradual movement of sounds through all five channels. At the start of the scene, we hear the sounds of the small “waiting area” where Maximus is preparing to do battle; muffled sounds from outside also play in the background. As Maximus moves out to the arena, the camera moves with him and the soundtrack begins to shift. It gradually introduces the sounds of the arena (now heard without the “muffling” effect) to the front center, then the entire front, then gradually the entire theater (as the sounds of the original waiting area fade out in the rears). This design effectively conveys the overwhelming sensation of moving from a tiny underground tunnel to a gigantic stadium filled with cheering spectators, and it is made more effective by the way all the main channels are used together to precisely shape the move between these two spaces.

## Contact

Rewatch opening scene in 5.1

{{% note %}}
The film opens on earth, then the camera begins tracking backward away from our planet through the outer reaches of the solar system all the way into deep space. As the camera pulls back, the soundtrack conveys that earth’s radio and television signals are traveling out into space by moving recognizable music and news clips from the back of the theater to the front. In other words, as the camera moves away from the earth, the sounds of history whiz by the audience—the effect is that of traveling backward both spatially and temporally. A similar sound effect (that of moving back into history) could possibly be created in a monophonic or Dolby Stereo environment—but this would not have the same psychological and narrative power as actually hearing history fly by.

## Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

places sounds all throughout the soundscape but carefully avoids putting effects in the surrounds that would draw attention away from the screen

{{% note %}}
For a lot of the background sounds and the walking on deck and such from a below-deck perspective, it worked very well to be all around us in the surrounds and in the front . . . there is nothing percussive only in the back that would draw you away from the front. It all worked together. . . . if you are looking at a ship scene from a deck perspective and you suddenly hear a rope crinkle, or some specific mast crack, or something behind you, it is distracting to the point where you are pulling people away from the story -- Paul Massey

## Avoiding the exit door effect - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)

Trailer - view on Apple TV Plus

{{% note %}}
The trailer for 2003’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake employs this strategy with great success. While the screen remains blank, a man’s heavy footsteps methodically pursue a woman—represented by her screams and running footsteps—around the multi-channel space of the theater, beginning in the back right channel and continuing around the front of the theater to the chase’s end in the front left channel. After the chainsaw roars into action, a simple title card reveals the name of the movie. In a mono environment, this trailer would be simply a lot of footsteps, a couple screams, and a saw powering up; in the multi-channel realm it becomes a clear and engrossing chase with no visuals required.

## Lifted (2006)

Play on Apple TV

{{% note %}}
The short Lifted (2006) uses careful placement of sounds around the multi-channel soundscape to indicate diegetic action beyond the edges of the frame. Here the abductor-in-training reacts to the offscreen sounds of an examiner making notes about his poor performance.

Throughout the piece, Rydstrom uses carefully panned sound effects to suggest both this (often offscreen) havoc and other diegetic sounds outside the borders of the frame, such as the trainee’s whining during a shot of his teacher making notes about his performance. One of the film’s funniest moments even relies on a surround effect: the abductor-in-training at last succeeds in directing the human out of the bedroom window—a success quickly marred by the fact that immediately after the body flies offscreen, a crash in the right surround channel reveals that it has hit a tree. This sound effect cues a cut to a wider shot revealing the body wedged in the tree’s branches. In this and other situations, Rydstrom carefully places sounds around the theater to heighten his film’s drama and/or comedy. But since all these sound effects have clearly indicated sources within the diegesis (even if those sources are not onscreen at the moment), the sound design never be- comes distracting or “too big” for the story.

## Panning and Dialogue

- The Kinsey example is a good one
- Also the T1000 melting at the end of Terminator 2

{{% note %}}
An even better indication of how much digital surround’s discrete channel design has affected mixing practices is that dialogue is slowly being liberated to move around the theater like other elements of the soundtrack. One of the cardinal principles of multi-channel panning has been to keep dialogue front and center; filmmakers using magnetic stereo in the 1950s quickly learned this lesson, and the Dolby Stereo system appearing twenty years later technologically codified this aesthetic guideline. But now that the discrete channels of digital surround have made it technically possible to place dialogue elsewhere in the theater, some filmmakers are breaking with decades-long conventions to take advantage of this capability.

The _Kinsey montage_ discussed earlier, for in- stance, gradually spreads the voices of its researchers’ interviewees around the whole soundscape, but it is clear in this case that no literal correspondence between image and sound is intended. In fact, while some of the voices in the montage are first heard in sync with onscreen faces, others are never associated with onscreen elements, and ultimately both types of voices spread into the surrounds even as some of the speakers’ faces remain onscreen.

The same fundamental principle is at play in the scene near the end of Terminator 2 where the T1000 (played by Robert Patrick) is melting in a pit of molten steel. Despite the T1000 remaining onscreen in a close shot, its screams whip around the surround channels.70 While this violates conventions of spatial matching between image and sound, it fits with the “spectacle” of the scene overall, recognizing that audiences are not expecting unadulterated realism out of this scene. Moreover, the T1000’s screams are, like the voices in the Kinsey montage, primarily effects rather than dialogue whose semantic meaning the audience is expected to decode.

## Transitory Panning - Ratatouille (2007)

- At the end of a scene in Gusteau’s restaurant

{{% note %}}
Transitory panning is another way for filmmakers to “bend” the rule that dialogue belongs in the front center channel without breaking it—in these cases voices are briefly placed offscreen but “rehabilitated” once they have served their purpose. As one sound editor explains, panned dialogue is often most palatable when it is used only briefly, such as when someone yells something from offscreen before the camera cuts to show that person.71 An example of this type of transitory dialogue panning is a sound transition between two scenes in Ratatouille (2007). At the end of a scene in Gusteau’s restaurant, the soundtrack introduces the beginning of a speech by Django (father of the film’s rat hero Remy). Django (voiced by Brian Dennehy) is speaking in the rat’s nest where Remy’s family lives, but his line begins a few seconds before the image track cuts away from the restaurant. Overlapping image and sound from different scenes is a common transitional device used to smooth over the edit between two locales; what is unusual here is that during the time the dialogue of one space overlaps with the image of the other, Ratatouille mixes Django’s voice to all five main channels. The rationale for this mixing strategy seems to be to keep the audience from assuming a particular spatial relationship between the two places and is therefore short lived—once the camera cuts to the rat’s nest and Django appears onscreen, it is no longer necessary, and the dialogue quickly collapses back to the front center.

## Natural soundscape - Strange Days (1995)

{{% note %}}
Strange Days (1995), for example, pans voices all around the audience to simulate the experience of real life, where dialogue can come from all sides. Rydstrom, the film’s sound designer, acknowledges that this was an unusual tactic to take, but points out that “It’s dangerous to have rules” and asserts that accurately spatializing the dialogue was the right decision for a story partly about a technology that captures real experiences.

## Unnatural soundscape - The Ring (2003)

{{% note %}}
Can't find clip

here Strange Days employs panned voices to create a better match between soundtrack and diegetic world, the same device can be used to prohibit a match from being made between the two. Gore Verbinski’s The Ring (2003) at one point mixes a child’s voice into all five channels simultaneously so that it cannot be associated with a single location. In this scene, the lead character is recalling something her son had said to her, and it is his voice that plays all around the auditorium.

## Full Frequency Channels

{{% note %}}
When SMPTE was developing the specifications for digital motion picture soundtracks, however, it recognized that the advantages of discrete channels would be partially lost if frequency limitations meant that the surround channels could only handle certain types of sounds. Hence SMPTE stipulated that every main channel be able to reproduce all audible frequencies.

The combination of full-range channels with a discrete channel configuration means not only that any sound can be placed in any channel, but that sounds can smoothly be panned from one channel to another. While brief stereo “fly-bys” across the front speakers have long been a staple of multi-channel soundtracks, digital surround sound represents the first commonplace system where sounds can move not just across the screen but all throughout the theater. Apocalypse Now famously panned helicopter sounds throughout the auditorium—but the full splendor of this multi-channel mix was only heard by viewers in a few showcase houses, as the standard 35mm Dolby Stereo prints of Apocalypse Now did not even include a surround channel.

## Low-Frequency Effects

- Phantom Menace Pod racer scene
- In _Lifted_: LFE used for UFO rumble

{{% note %}}
One channel in the 5.1 digital surround configuration does not have full-range capabilities: the “.1” low-frequency effects (LFE) channel.

The podrace sequence in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999) demonstrates digital surround sound’s unique technical capabilities: the LFE channel makes the podracers seem “powerful,” and the discrete, full-range channel configuration enables the sounds of the racers to smoothly move around the auditorium to match the visuals.
