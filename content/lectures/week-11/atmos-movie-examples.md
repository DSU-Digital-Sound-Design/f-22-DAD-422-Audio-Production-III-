## Brave With Atmos

While researching this story, I watched Brave twice – once in a regular theater and once at the AMC Van Ness, one of 14 theaters in the United States currently set up to run Atmos. With Atmos, Brave was a substantially better movie. The mix was a hybrid – about 75 percent was in Dolby 7.1, a mix helmed by Skywalker Sound's Gary Rydstrom, with about 25 percent subtly separated out into Atmos by Files.

The difference was palpable.

The dramatic tension in Brave between feisty female heroine Merida and her prim mother, Queen Elinor, felt more convincing. Elinor's transformation into a bear mid-movie was more sudden and horrifying. And Merida and Elinor's reconciliation by the end of the film came as less of a predictable happy ending; it felt more genuine and heartwarming.

When there was emotional distance between Merida and her mother, Files put their voices into objects, pointing the voices to separate speakers. Merida and her mother weren't just separated visually on-screen; they were separated sonically, too.

"In the system, we separate them slightly so Mom comes from the speaker in the left side of the screen," Files said. "Merida comes from the right side of the screen ... putting some distance between them, physically and emotionally."

Meanwhile, the Queen and her adoring, bumbling husband, King Fergus, were always in the same speaker, subtly underlining the closeness between them.

In a key scene in the movie, set at the dinner table in the castle, Elinor informs Merida that she has to get married. Merida is having none of it. Under the huge wooden table, three little triplets – who are mainly in the movie for comic relief – frantically munch dessert.

"One of my favorite parts of the mix is when you go under the table in that scene – down under the table with the triplets, and they're eating cookies," Files said. "We took Dad's voice and put it on the ceiling.... It helps tell the story of what it feels like to be these little boys under the table, and have this big, giant dad up above them, booming down."

When Queen Elinor morphs into a giant bear, Atmos made her seem more gigantic and terrifying. Files sent the bear's voice to an overhead speaker, so that the creature seemed to literally tower above the audience. Merida's voice, meanwhile, was pointed to a speaker far below the bear's voice, making her appear dramatically smaller.

Then, in the dramatic finale, when Merida and her mother reconcile, their voices are joined in the same speaker.

It was a bit of sonic sleight of hand, but it worked wonders to imbue Brave with unexpected emotional depth. Pixar's visual fireworks dominated the screen, but the sound had subtly become the star of the show.

"What we want the audience to do is to not think about the sound," said Skywalker Sound's Files. "We want it to be subtle. That's when sound operates most effectively on the audience."

> Also, various action scenes make heavy use of object based audio.
