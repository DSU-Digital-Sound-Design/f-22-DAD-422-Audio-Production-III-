# Dolby Atmos with films

## A somewhat critical take

{{% note %}}
We skipped ahead a bit to talk about using atmos with music, but it was originally designed for mixing films.

The first film that used Atmos was a pixar short that played before Brave called "Leaf". Somehow this movie is not on IMDB, not sure why.

Development and Deployment: Launching into the Dolby Atmos
“This has been a real evolutionary process,” declares Stuart Bowling (senior technical marketing manager for cinema at Dolby), explaining that the genesis of the Dolby Atmos platform goes back as far as 2007. “We were approached by a major exhibitor who was looking to the future and saying, ‘We are going to start changing the way in which we design and build our auditoriums. With all the changes in imaging technology, something has to happen with audio. What would that look like?’ Dolby was already looking at that same question, but our ability to change the industry was partly held back because the footprint of digital was still relatively small at that time by comparison to where we are now.”

So what was Dolby saying at the time Atmos was coming out about why this was an important and new invention?

More than a technical novelty or specialized exhibition format, the company’s long-term goal is to feature Atmos in “every movie and every theater” (Fuchs 2012). According to film historian Gianluca Sergi, Atmos represents Dolby Laboratories’ larger goal of recapturing “the prime position that it held in the cinema market, both internally to the company and externally in the industry” after more than two years of revenue decline in its digital cinema division (2013: 109).

Between 2010 and 2013, Dolby reached out to sound practitioners, directors, studios and major theater chains using financial incentives, complimentary training sessions and a barrage of trade advertisements to promote the format as the future of cinema sound production and exhibition. To accomplish this widespread adoption and implementation strategy, Atmos proposes a re-evaluation of Hollywood sound mixing conventions and practices, many of which are rooted in the professional identities, social organization and creative work of mixers themselves. **Despite Dolby’s claim that their new platform allows mixers to retain more artistic control over their work at different stages of production and exhibition, there is considerable evidence that Atmos actually limits a mixer’s creative role in authoring soundtracks.**

## Implications

- technological
- occupational
- aesthetic

We'll go into the large-scale _technological, occupational and aesthetic implications_ of the Atmos format on the art and craft of Hollywood sound mixing.

_Technological_

The first is based on what Dolby claims is the “intuitive” design of the format, which uses a digital rendering algorithm that is responsive to variations in theater room size and loudspeaker configuration. The backward-compatible system aims to simplify distribution with a Digital Cinema Package (DCP) that outputs to different digital sound configurations, including 5.1 and 7.1, in a process Dolby calls “Author Once, Optimize Everywhere.”

_Workflow_

a shift in creative workflow that requires mixers to adapt their professional style to the nuances of the Atmos system. In some cases, Dolby has offered training sessions at their San Francisco and Burbank offices to familiarize mixers with the format. While Dolby engineers and consultants claim not to place creative constraints on how film-makers use the system, some mixers have already expressed frustration with the automated algorithm that automatically down-mixes an Atmos pass to 5.1 and 7.1 configurations. In this way, mixers “capture their creative content” and then let the algorithm “generate” alternate versions in the box (Dolby Laboratories 2013a: 1, 14)

_Aesthetic_

Finally, the persistent strains of “realism” and the promise of “lifelike audio” continue to shape Dolby’s aims for Atmos and multichannel film sound in general. These discourses, which feature prominently in the Dolby Atmos White Paper, emphasize the format’s ability to place sounds around the auditorium with a greater level of screen accuracy, leading to what Dolby believes is a “heightened sense of realism without being obvious” (7). However, sound mixers often avoid “realism” in favor of dramatic “feel” and other aesthetic factors that push beyond accurate representations of sound/picture scale.
