# First-Order Ambisonics (FOA)

{{% note %}}
Essentially based on similar considerations as MS, one can define first-order Ambisonic recording. For 2D recordings, a Double-MS microphone arrangement is suitable and only requires one more microphone than MS recording: a front-back oriented figure-of-eight microphone. The scheme is extended to 3D first-order Ambisonics by a third figure-of-eight microphone of up-down aiming.

### 2D First-Order Ambisonic Recording and Playback

{{% note %}}
The first-order Ambisonic format in 2D consists of one signal corresponding to an omnidirectional pickup pattern (called W), and two signals corresponding to the figure-of-eight pickup patterns aligned with the Cartesian axes (X and Y).

{{% note %}}
In 2018 US-company Core Sound, which also produces the ‘TetraMic,’ has come up with the first commercially available ‘Second-Order Ambisonic’ (SOA) microphone: the ‘OctoMic’ is made up of 8 capsules with cardioid characteristics, which apparently allows not only for a broad range of first- and second-order microphone patterns but also delivers more accurate spatial impression and localization due to better signal separation between the capsules.

### Zylia

[ZM-1](https://www.zylia.co/zylia-zm-1-microphone.html)

{{% note %}}
Around the same time, Polish company Zylia has released their third-order Ambisonics (TOA) microphone ‘ZM-1,’ based on 19 omni-directional capsules. Accompanying software enables beamforming and the creation of useful microphone patterns for 2D and 3D Audio use, including binaural signal generation.
